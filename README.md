# Twitter Bot for Resources during the COVID emergencies 

@ResourcesBot
 searches for ver*fied leads on Twitter and replies to SOS tweets with a bunch of links. As a failsafe, we have a beta website you can go to to check if the bot missed any sources.

Want to help? Some possible PR we'd love to have

[] Classify between relevant and irrelevant tweets <br>
[] Add a search bar to the website <br>
[] Pagination on website <br>
[] Cleaner time presentation

If you cannot code, there are still ways to help this collective cause.

1. Please don't use the words ver*fied, oxy*en, Hosp*tal unless you have a lead. This can pollute searches. While we're building a classifier behind the scenes, you can help us and the other people searching manually optimize their results.
2. If you're uploading a screenshot, make sure to add the keywords and numbers in the twitter textbox. Helps in being blind-friendly and helps our bot and search results of the people.
3. Don't singularly rely on this tool, there are some amazing threads you can refer to. Here is one: https://external.sprinklr.com/insights/explorer/dashboard/601b9e214c7a6b689d76f493/tab/5?id=DASHBOARD_601b9e214c7a6b689d76f493
4. Tag @resourcesbot under SOS tweets.
5. donate blood, plasma (if eligible) or resource thru trusted sources (Sandeep Nailwal for example)
6. wear a mask, maintain distance
